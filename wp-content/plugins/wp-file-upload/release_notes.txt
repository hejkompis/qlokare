<span><strong>Latest release notes: </strong>This release introduces an improvement in <strong>filename sanitization</strong>. Before a file is uploaded its name is checked for invalid characters and corrected (sanitized). Now the plugin uses native Wordpress functions to sanitize the filename. It uses two sanitization modes, a <em>'loose'</em> one that only strips invalid characters and a <em>'strict'</em> one (default) that also converts non-latin characters to latin. Mode is defined by <em>'Filename Sanitization Mode'</em> environment variable. Furthermore this release introduces <strong>Chinese translation</strong>, kindly provided by <strong>Yingjun Li</strong>
